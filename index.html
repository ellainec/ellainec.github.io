				<h2>About me</h2>
				
				<img id="profile_pic" src="images/me.jpg">

				<p> Hello, my name is Ellaine and I’m a kick-ass coder.</p>
				
				<p>Ok, that’s a lie. I’m not <em>yet</em> but I plan to be. I’m currently enrolled in the Computer
				Systems Technology program at BCIT. It's a tough program with a fast pace, but I'm loving every 
				second of it.</p>
				
				<p>In my previous life (which wasn't too long ago I guess, but sure feels like it!), I had graduated 
				from SFU with a Bachelor of Business Administration from Simon Fraser University. With that, I spent 
				around 4 years helping a IT services company source, negotiate and manage their global vendors and 
				contracts.</p>
				
				<p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me baking sourdough bread, crocheting a cup cozy, 
				or knitting something like a scarf or hat. When the weather is warm, I might be outside 
				satisfying my green thumb and tending to my vegetables. Having said this, I'd like to point out that I'm 
				not 85 as my particular set of hobbies might hint otherwise.</p>
